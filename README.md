# SignUp_App

## 100 Days Of Swift & iOS

Built an app that takes a username and password from user. It controls username and password and then sign-up to app.
I practiced on Segue, Optionals, Alerts, Functions and Lifecycle.

-> General view of app's main page.

-> if the user types wrong password or username (it does matter. There are different situations for each.)

-> if the user types his/her password and username correctly, he/she sign up to app successfully. (There is no saving process to Database, it's just symbolic app.)
